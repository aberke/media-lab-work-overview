				<h1>BEAUTIFUL SYMMETRY: A COLORING BOOK ABOUT MATH</h1>
				<img height="200px" src="img/book-cover-mit.jpg" />

				<p><a target="_blank" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/beautiful-symmetry">https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/beautiful-symmetry</a></p>
				<p>The MIT Press is publishing my book March 2020.</p>
				<p>This book is an introduction to the mathematics of symmetry (group theory).  The math is explained with illustrations and challenges the reader to deeply engage with coloring puzzles throughout.  This book is dual medium, and the first of its kind.  All of the content comes to life in interactive animations with the free online version.</p>

				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.beautifulsymmetry.onl">http://beautifulsymmetry.onl</a></p>
				<p>I created this book to make math more accessible to a broad audience and it has already been used as a resource by educators all over the world.</p>

				<h1>CRYPTO VOTING & U.S. ELECTIONS: REALITY & SCIENCE FICTION</h1>

				<img height="150px" src="img/i-voted-pins-with-hash.png"/>

				<p>I extensively researched cryptographically secure voting systems in the context of U.S. elections and published my work in an accessible 2-part series. One part is about reality. The other part is science fiction.</p>
				<br/>
				<h4><a href="https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/crypto-voting-us-elections-reality-554214b5c84">Crypto Voting & U.S. Elections: Reality</a></h4>
				<p class='italic'>On the security of blockchain, internet, and end-to-end verifiable voting systems, including the  cryptography behind how they work.</p>

				<h4><a href="https://medium.com/@aberke/crypto-voting-us-elections-science-fiction-fb1e4af2d13a">Crypto Voting & U.S. Elections: (Science Fiction) Short Stories From Potential Futures</a></h4>
				<p class='italic'>These stories consider two potential futures for US democracy, branching from our present. One is dystopian, the other utopian.</p>

				<br/>

				<p>This timely work has been heralded by experts, such as the director of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, and the President of the U.S. Vote Foundation, who republished the work under the title <span style="display: inline-block;">"If You Ever Read An Article on Online Voting: Make It This One":</span> <a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/blockchain-mobilevoting-lostchoices-plutocracy">https://usvotefoundation.org/blockchain-mobilevoting-lostchoices-plutocracy</a></p>

				<h1>[BIKE] SWARM</h1>

				<p>I designed a synchronized light system for bicycles that builds a unified presence for cyclists on the road, whereby riders collaboratively enhance their shared safety while creating a visual representation of community.</p>
				<p><a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/bike-swarm/overview/">https://media.mit.edu/projects/bike-swarm</a></p>
				<p>I led both the conceptual and technical work to build and test this system, with collaborators in the City Science group.  This project demonstrates my design, software, hardware engineering, and entrepreneurial skills.</p>

				<br/>
				<h4>DesignX</h4>
				<p>[bike] swarm was accepted to MIT’s competitive DesignX Venture Accelerator Program - <a href='https://designx.mit.edu'>https://designx.mit.edu</a></p>
				<br/>
				<p>I also authored 2 accepted conference papers for [bike] swarm with City Science collaborators: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3311957.3359508">CSCW paper</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z8rZcp9xY5d1T-8epQ7Xw7Pm47yJyhuQ/view">SAI computing paper</a></p>

				<h1>WINNING A CRYPTOCURRENCY ARBITRAGE & TRADING COMPETITION AT MIT</h1>
				<p>I won a competition in writing algorithmic cryptocurrency trading programs.  The competition was hosted by the MIT Bitcoin Club over the MIT 2019 IAP term.</p>
				<img height="100px" src="img/winning-crypto-competition.png">
				<p>I won this competition by designing and implementing the most successful arbitrage strategy. I then wrote a popular blog post about cryptocurrencies and arbitrage, and other takeaways from the experience: <a style="display: inline-block;" href="https://medium.com/celohq/arbitrage-and-winning-a-cryptocurrency-trading-competition-at-mit-32e183766e42">https://medium.com/celohq/arbitrage-and-winning-a-cryptocurrency-trading-competition-at-mit-32e183766e42</a></p>

				<h1>BLACK MIRROR DISCUSSION SERIES</h1>
				<p>I co-designed and facilitated a biweekly discussion series about emerging technologies and the ethics around developing and deploying them.</p>
				<img height="300px" src="img/black-mirror-poster.png">
				<p>This series brought together the directors of Media Lab research groups and the MIT community, in thoughtful discussions after watching Black Mirror episodes.  These events gained popularity and often reached space capacity.</p>

				<h1>INCOME, RACE, BIKES</h1>
				<p>Is the placement of bike-share docks equitable?  I crunched bike-share and population demographic data and developed an interactive map to explore this question visually, across multiple cities and multiple years.</p>

				<h1>PRIVATE LOCATION DATA FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD AND URBAN UNDERSTANDING</h1>
				<p>My thesis leverages machine learning and data science tools to make otherwise highly private location data, which is ubiquitously collected from the pubic via smartphones, safe and useful for cities and public good projects.</p>
				<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ZMBDvAES_EM6s7iisRE-wCO7KAuoWdA/view">[link]</a>
				<p>This work includes development of a novel method for synthetic data generation for use in modeling.</p>

				<p>Before coming to the Media Lab I worked for years as a software engineer and technologist in industry, at the intersection of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">technology</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">social impact</span>. I have extensive experience in developing highly available and distributed systems, human-centered design, and working with startups as well as large companies.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Directly before the Media Lab I worked as a software engineer on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Google Search</span>, on a team tasked with news credibility and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fighting disinformation</span>.</p>

				<br/>
				<p class="italic">I addition I...</p>
				<br/>
